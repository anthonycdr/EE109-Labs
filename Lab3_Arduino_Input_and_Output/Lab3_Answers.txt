		       Lab 3 - Arduino Input and Output

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit
2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

This approach overwrites all bits in PORTD, including bits 5-3, which are now used for buttons. 
This clears their pull up resistors, making the buttons unresponsive. A better option is to write PORTD |= 0x04 instead to modify only bit 2.


2. (2 points) Note that in Lab 2 we found that the delay of a NOT gate
(hardware only) is around 10ns and this measurement was very
consistent. However, the delay measured in this lab is on the order of 10
microseconds (hardware + software) and varies considerably from measurement to
measurement. Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements.

Hint: ignore the hardware propagation delays which are very small (tens of ns),
and think about how your program executes.

The delay varies due to software execution; we know from lecture that hardware is faster than software. 
The button press is checked in a loop, so detection depends on timing. 
Debouncing which is when the button is pressed and execution overhead which is the software logic also contribute to variations, making the delay inconsistent.
